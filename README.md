product and price from the site. Once selection of product completion , import the requests andÂ  beautiful soup from Bs4 .
Defining the check price and URL content from the page obtained through beautiful soup library help to retrieve information from
site. The title and price for the product to be specified and we define a converted price so that once the price go down will keep a
update on it and for this to send a mail for Notification whenever the price fell down, we require a server setup which can be done
through importing SMTP library and then set the email id for the mail to be sent.
